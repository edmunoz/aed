CAC 2016 Post Match Interviews & Press Conference
What I like about USA is that they recognize the fact that they are underdogs but they continue to fight and play regardless of who they go up against which I love about them. It's a huge accomplishment to get to the semifinals for them and I applaud them for that
Why is Bradley on the team? There are many other players in the U.S who can play better. Im sorry but Bradley is slow, and messes up good plays with his poor passing. And hes horrible at defense.
Get em next time! Getting better just gotta work on breaking that pressure and pas the ball smartly! 21 or 22 years since you guys been here is an achievement. Great job! Never gave up! Now get 3rd place and make us proud soccer is in the USA!
Sorry Bradley, there is always room still on TFC, you're a great player for us, but MLS caliber players can never top World Class European or South American futbol style. Good effort for the USA, you'll eventually get there, but Argentina is top class. VAMOS ARGENTINA!!
Congratulations por lo menos llegaron a cuartos de final y se enfrentaron con un excelente equipo
Usa is a great team, but I didn't like the coach approach in today's game..and Dempsey's absence was the worst of it..cause he knows how to make passes, move the ball in the field and the best he makes goals ⚽️⚽️⚽️
Fútbol de laboratorio, no tienen pasión ni sentimiento!! CONCACAF no existe!!!!
Congrats USA you did a lot for the first time to be on semifinals special to play with the best time Argentina and Messi the best player of the world Congrats to Argentina team
How come Bradley kept passing the ball back to Argentina?
Te amo USA , llegaron lejos, que otros grandes ni ahi, sigan trabajando duro p
Graham Zusi the best! 🇺🇸👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Always in all the field! Giving his best! Grande Leo! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇦🇷
You guys did great! I'm glad that I'm in my adulthood and really enjoying my team get as far as they did!
lets be honest, everybody knew that argentina was gonna win.. atleast u.s.a got to the semis!!
Porque no tiraron botellasos y basura? Oh es que no habian asquerosos msl amanzados mexiAnos.
That moment you realize USA might play Colombia for the 3rd place spot...
At least we didn't face weak teams like y'all that's is how y'all got there
Wondo is a scrub. Beckerman scrub. Guzan super scrub. Zusi is master scrub. Bradley was captain scrub
Feel like the ref made some poor calls. But I don't know how much of a difference that honestly made
Ask him if he knows how to pass a soccer ball...
Proud of you guys. You guys played against number one team in the world plus best player ever
Por que cambian a Demsey… really? That was a bad move!!!
This guy had almost as many assists to Argentina as Messi did. How many passes did he complete?
Somos una página que acaba de empezar sin embargo tendremos información de sobra, fuentes cercanas a los clubes y muchas dinamicas que les encantaran! necesitamos su like para empezar a crecer GRACIAS!...
Argentina no tiene una historia de casualidad . Es mucho más que los demás. Messi de otro planeta.
This dude needs to leave the USA team. He hurts them so much and they don't realize it
Am soo sooo sorry 😥
Me siento feliz porque gano argentina le cerro la boca a dos paises que odian y ven como basuras al latino viva argentina
US lost against the best team. Made it to the semi-finals....good things will come.
They should be proud they got as far as they did....they lost against the best soccer team in the world....not bad.
The U.S did better than Mexico. Klinsi is going to have to make a few changes though.
Lets admitted people this is the worse version of USA and MEXICO soccer teams 😡
How many assists did Bradley have for Argentina?
What do you expect with that horrible soccer???, win?? Please!!!
USA has a lot to be proud of, and also a lot to work on! I see a bright future!
Bradley is trash!🗑
Nice job bradley u got an assist on the last goal
Chins up!
No llores mijo
GO YANKS 3RD PLACE
Don't worry USA.... You are young in futbol... Now Mexico, they been playing for ever... And they lost 7 to zero against Chile....
Faltaron muchos para los 7 ....!! USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Feels better then a 7
"Por lo menos no nos metieron 7, una vez más demostramos que no tenemos nivel ya que año tras año seguimos creyendo que tenemos una Confederación buena pero ya vemos que no, ojala que algún día seamos potencia y dejemos de ser la vergüenza de América. Un saludo grande para mi familia y para mis hermanos mexicanos, pinches cabrones son peor que nosotros jajaja siete te hicieron vergüenza das! 

Michael Bradley
