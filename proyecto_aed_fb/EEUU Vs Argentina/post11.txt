CAC 2016 Post Match Interviews & Press Conference U.S. Soccer
I'm proud to be an Argentinian and an American.
US fans be proud of this team you just played the best team in the world along with the best player. 🇦🇷🇺🇸 #ARGENTINA #SomosArgentina
Semifinals .... Not bad USA....Argentina is just simply better team (at least it wasn't 7-0 😛)
Yeah Argentina is the number one team, but Come on, USA is not at the level that the other South American teams are, with time, work, determination, you will improve.
Look I'm a Mexico fan, however I was rooting for the USA being that they represented concacaf but Klinsman player selection, tactic was horrendous! HE NEEDS TO GO, USA is time for Klinsman to go....!
Uh...no entiendo un choto pero traduzco: Argentina nos rompió el poto, mejor me voy a comer estrudel jaja
Not Team USA's best game by far, but nonetheless I am proud of my team. We Americans never quit and never surrender. We will continue to get better and improve our youth development programs. That is what's desperately needed here in the US, because the world class footballers you see in other countries just aren't here yet. But one day they will. Go Team USA !!
As predicted, Argentina will go to the Final and USA will fight for 3rd place. Still ♡ Team USA and the fans in Houston. Surely shown the world what good sportsmanship look like. Go USA!
There is North American Soccer and South American Futbol. Different level people.
This is the kind of match that makes the USA better and better, you should be proud!, Argentina is in a good place with so many great players and of course Messi!
USMNT got a reality check. Argentina is on another level. Nothing Klinsman could do about it even if they had the squad at full strength.
I'm glad he wants a friendly with them. I'm open for seeing us challenge ourselves against top teams. Only way to develop further right now.
Why are you blaming the manager as if we were guaranteed a victory? Heck we didn't even have access to all of the better players we have (not that it would've helped win)  while Argentina had all men on deck. We lost to their A+ team tonight.
USA football will never be great because of two reasons. 1- it doesn't come from the hood. 2- not enough people play it in the US.
Chupen chupen yankis de mierda ladrones imperialistas!! $$$$
En algo no van a ganar y es siempre en más puro deporte que es el fútbol
QUE LA CHUPEN Y LA SIGAN CHUPANDO!!
Don't worry USA, you've just lost against the best team in the world.
esto es la copa america no la copa de oro  jajaajaj  la sudamericana siempre superior
Very good match made tremendous role in this cup always proud of U S A🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The manager is fine. It's the players that choke in the big games!
Our team does not have the depth or talent to play Argentina. Bradley once again played for the other team
Hey Americans, stop attacking the manager ( you have no players) =D
Al menos no les metieron siete
Is better loses 4-0 than 7-0 viva Mexico!!!
So happy Argentina won!!!! USA plays way to dirty!!! They should not be proud of their winnings.
No pude ver la marca a Messi....alguien la vio??? Jajaja vamos argentina!!! Esta copa es nuestra
Team usa did great👏 but they definitely vs. a hard team.😕Next time🇺🇸
Don't blame on klinsmann. People should notice that the academy development failure is the main problem.
Why would anyone foul Messi so close to the half moon? Bad mistake
How can they watch this game afterwards and not see that Bradley is a waste of a spot?
Messi is going to end up in tears are the end .
CHILE MIERDA CAMPEON DE AMERICA
👏👏👏👏good Job USA!! You were awesome, very Nice Hosting Team!! It was not easy with Argentina!! I'm proud of USA Team!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸⚽️⚽️⚽️👏👏👏
That Was Hard to watch but still usa made it far ❤️
Somos una página que acaba de empezar sin embargo tendremos información de sobra, fuentes cercanas a los clubes y muchas dinamicas que les encantaran! necesitamos su like para empezar a crecer GRACIAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
USA un gran equipo, desafortunadamente jugaron con uno de Los grandes..
We have all resources, courage and people to become one of the best "football" nations in the World. But why aren't we?
messi messi, best player of the world!!❤️❤️❤️
Copacabana America belongs to South America s,end of story.
We need Donovan!!!!!
Final. 
Conmebol vs conmebol. 
El futbol no miente aveces da sorpresas pero esta vez ha sido justo GRANDE SUDAMERICA.
Pero cuando los quieren deportar ahí están llorando !!  Pidiendo derechos en un país que no nacieron!!  Ridiculos  payasos de circo barato !
"We're proud to represent CONCACAF in the Copa America semifinals. "

US team. 

They're pathetic.

😂😂😂😂😂😂
GRAAAAAANDE KLINSMANN ... Igual USA NO tenía Naaada que perder !!!!!!!
It's not always about the coach. He's a great coach, but the players??😩😩😩
What do you expect you are playing against the best player in the planet Leo Messy
Klinsmann deep inside his head is saying "haha im german back when i played we always beat argentina, and still do"...
USA played an amazing game and to be able to get to the semi finals is amazing 🇺🇸🇺🇸😘🙌
Klinsman was a great player. One of the best Germans ever.
USA no merecia estar en semifinales, le quedo muy grande el partido
No pride, no skill, can't seem to get world class athletes to play at the highest level
En que see parece mex y usa..en q nos sentimos grandes con mini equipos ...llegan los grandes y nos goleannnnnn
Messi once agains proves he is the best player in the world.
Please, for the love of God Jurgen, STOP PLAYING WONDO AND BECKERMAN. PLEASE GOD.
Para ese payaso q dice q los quieren deportar tambuen t dieron x el orto ingenuo 🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿
che klisman y la marca sobre messi? jajajajajaja, fuiste buen jugador deja de robar como dt
Ganarle a Haití, Cuba, El Salvador, Belice, Trinidad, Canadá, Jamaica, Barbados, Antillas, Santa Lucia, San Vicente y Las Granadinas, Antigua y Barbuda, Aruba....y demás porquerías si son "grandes" jajajaja. ESA ES SU REALIDAD AMERICANOS, sigan jugando contra isluchas donde el fútbol es amateur. CONMEBOL es OTRO NIVEL! no están a la altura de Sudamérica. CONMEBOL MANDA! Concacaf NO EXISTE!.
Wondolowski shouldn't have started. Flatfooted and lazy.
US didn't play as they should. ...next time better mentality. ...we can do it! We are USA! Little by little. ...
This is a good preparation for the US team, especially if they want to play in World Cup.
The effort was not there at all for the U.S. Argentina was just passing circles around them all night. 🇦🇷🇦🇷
Bradley is the worst. He brings the team down every time he plays.
The US players did not step up to play tonight. They were very timid.
Si pero quien es el mejor jugador del mundo acaso un aleman no es argentino y es messi papa
GO TEAM USA✌️✌✌✌YALL DID SUCH A GREAT JOB.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Does anyone know why Tim Howard didn't play at all? I'm surprised he didn't get some playing time today
Well team USA has played the same game, it was boring!!
Shame coach. You suppose to play the same way not defending mode. You know this way USA didn't have a
y dónde se metieron los mexicanos, que se sentían ganadores de este torneo como "locales" y su fútbol "superior" al sudamericano????
No you can't critical any player, because the problem is you!!!
Viejo baboso ya es tiempo que lo cambien USA nesecita otro técnico
Lo único bueno de que jueguen con los equipos de Sudamérica es que el árbitro es neutral.
No como en CONCACAF que siempre benefician a Mexico y USA.😡
Zardes was the only player who showed up for the US
It's a process that has been going on for over five years...
I have never seen them play so bad. Bradley played horrible and once again we proved that we have no skill on the ball.
Good game guys!!!! ❤️🇺🇸⚽️TEAM!
Good Morning Klinsi aus Berlin 
GOOD Job of The Play Copa Amerika
Habe a Nice Day
Love you Messi
Argentina played well but don't forget that Germany is still world champion jajajaja! 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
We love both and they are good players. Argentina won.
The rest of the world is lucky our world class athletes play baseball and football.
Well said Klinsmann! Argentina is a class for itself...it's still a long process for Soccer in the U.S.!
Sólo directores técnicos argentinos... y ningún equipo de la concacaf...!
Hola quiero mandarle un saludo a Brasil.. Nos vemos marta de berazategui
Futboleros deja de romper las bolas con tu página, en todos lados dejas ese mensaje!
What's the fuss?!...The game that I saw was between the 2016 MLS All-Stars vs Argentina.
We need better talent and team chemistry to compete with the top teams.
I finish with this. Us never had a chance against two -time winner of the World FIFA World Cup
Argentina is way too BIG of a team for a USA team that has no real love for the game
This is soccer NO baseball
We did good not having all our players
Good job coach
Fired this guy
Football made easy by Messi... He is gifted naturally. God bless America God bless messi
Why is it not ok to be upset / disappointed?  Not in the overall loss, but in the way they played-
Missing those 3 and that 3 minute goal is what killed us. Good try guys, let's get that 3rd!
We need a new coach
Fernando Germany is still the best team in the world
Felicitaciones Argentina. El mejor equipo del torneo
USA first need to stop calling this game "soccer"
Carlos Alvarado, no es soccer es fútbol
Argentina better team always ☆
Wondo was a mistake
Better team won period.
I'm sick and tired to hear this man always praising other players but he's own. until when is he staying? I think is now time for a new leader. the USA never had a chance with Argentina, specially when Dempsey was absent the whole time, the only  one running there today was zardes. I think this guy is an idiot.
Bradley had at least one assist for Argentina tonight.
Messi was the answer
Messi himself smash the US
Yankees go home! Jajaja
Donovan could not have changed the score line
Donovan
El tonto de rie para no llorar los violaron jajajaj
Mesiiiii the BEST!!!!
CONMEBOL 11 - CONCACAF 0
Welcome to CONMEBOL
♥️🇺🇸⚽️❗️
Fútbol- 4 Soccer-0 😎😎
Fútbol 4 soccer 0
Jugaron porque tenian que jugar...pero pues ya todos sabiamos Argentina es mucho equipo sin des-meritar el poco trabajo de USA.
No chance when MESSI is on the field lol
US soccer will not improve with him , get rid of him !!!!
well, it is still better than mexico's loss
He's not a loser..
El solo queria ver de cerca a messi jajaajaja esta feliz
Klinsmann should be a technical director or be fired as a coach .He's only better scouting European born players for the MNT. Honestly in his 5 year tenure he's behind Bruce Arena and Bob Bradley. Because they at least beat top 10 fifa ranked teams in big tournaments, not friendly matches.
Fire him!!!!!
Sorry but Germany! Won the world cup buddy
Why was Wondoloski in the game?!?
Inválidos Unidos
Jugo EEUU?
Houston, you have a problem
Messi Power !!!
Aguante messi
Why is he smiling
No existen morros
Us play good to me for not having stars
donde estan los mexicanos? creyendose mucho?
7-0
Too much respect to the Argentina players.
No excuses
This coach  is a such a loser!
0-4
Fire this guy already
Se salvaron grande
Messi les rompió el.orto
Conmebal  rules yankee go home
Did good at least he got tot the semi finals
USA needs to change the whole team .
This is Conmebol jaa No Concacaf
USA seemed to play like they were intimidated
Better than 7-0
The class difference is day and night
Argentina was walking on the fuel they didn't even try
Well, our coach looks happy.
🇺🇸💪🏽👏🏽😍😘🇺🇸👏🏽🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Sir, you should leave the Team USA 🇺🇸
You've got to be kidding me Ray RG
GOOD JOB USA WE WITH YOU NO MATTER WHAT
madafaka
El tipo está re feliz jajajaa
When is Mexico playing again?
Fire the entire team.
Bradley picked the worst time to play his worst game!
Bradley is garbage.
Venezuela played better than the us
Away with him!!!!
Obama precidendte
Como perdimos con ese equipo🇨🇷
Try n try until u success⚽️⚽️⚽️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🏆🏆🏆🏆
Hermanoo argentina te rompio el ojete!!!

Why take out Dempsey

Without Klinsi the USA wouldn't be so good in soccer
When they have confidence they are retired. Lol
Jajaja
You are a bad loser

Now it's time to beat Chile!!!
Also we never said. Sorry it was my foul

Thank you, Juergen, for all that you've done for the US team.
No excuses Argentina is the number one ranked team in the world and Messi is the best player in the world unless it's Ronaldo but Argentina won and that's it. We are proud That USA got to a 5th game to the final four and now will play a 6th game for 3rd or 4th and that  isn't bad out of 16 teams
BIENVENIDOS ESTO ES LA COPA AMERICA !!!
How come Bradley kept passing the ball back to Argentina?
😂😂😂😂😂

The important part is that we made it to the semi-finals. And yes we lost to Argentina but that's how the USMNT can learn from their mistakes and come back stronger. Jürgen Klinsmann your the best 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼.

The 7-0 spanking from Chile could've easily happen to the US team.. Not sure why they act like oh not us lol. To be honest chile played like the 300 Spartans all game... Arg cruised through easily. How is 4-0 better than 7-0... Last meeting Sep 2015 mex n arg tied 2-2 they scored in 85' and 89' to tie Mexico
Klinsmann gotta go
Mexixcan and.usa os good only for. Guatemala. Ur like jamainca
