#USMNT players speak in the mixed zone in #Houston. #Copa100
At least it wasn't 7-0...sorry México but at least we get to play for 3rd/4th place. .I think they did good considering it'd been a long time that USA even qualified for Copa America. .way to go
Dice: "lo unico que queriamos es conocer a Messi y afortunadamente gracias a Dios pudimos jugar con él, ha sido pequeñito pero juega bien y no aguanto las ganas de contarle a mis amigos que jugue contra Messi, nos vamos felices"
We are still proud of you USA... Losing to Argentina is nothing to be embarrassed about.
USA Showed too much respect for Argentina. That was a nice dance for the Argentines.
What a game! Great goals and great play. As a US fan, that was a fun game to watch... A little bit
Incredible game! Spoke very well, it is a huge accomplishment
Ehhh. It was like a blow out but... It was a good game. Good job US men. Im proud of u guys
4-0 and they played well? Not to say that Argentina stopped playing with 30 mins to go.
They're playing against the best in the world well said
Please! They are ranked #1 in the world. There is a reason for that. Don't undermine their skills on the pitch.

Argentina is a great team, I'm a little sad because USA is the local team, USA play hard and make a good job on the tournament, wining a top team on Conmebol  like Ecuador it's not easy like many say but anyway Arriba la Argentina.
USA should  just change the whole team . Keep Yedlin the rest are done .
Como quedaron gua temala  ,  el salvador,  honduras ,?   
Oops sorry
Bradley is the coach's son.  He won't go.
Carded is so positive.  Great player!
Super Argentina 👏👏👏👏👏👈👈👈⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
