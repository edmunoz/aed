U.S. Soccer Mixed Zone at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, AZ
If that's what we've accomplished in the last 5-6 yrs. we should be embarrassed by that performance. It was painful to watch a team with no tactical goal and  no meaningful fight to create chances. Get rid of Klinsmann. His playing career success is do to his successful teammates who carried him. Pathetic performance. C'mon Gulati, pull the friggin trigger and appoint someone who can hold the players accountable...
You cant replace Klinsmann , We played well tonight and got to the semi finals. Nagbe and Pulisic got some valuable playing time and the emergence of Bobby Wood. The World Cup qualifiers start soon to change coaches would be stupid!
Bradley didn't want to play he needs to bench!!! HORRIBLE!! Nagbe should start!! Zardes should not start it should be Pulisic .... But the root of the problem is Klinsmann!!!! The guy needs to go.  I was the biggest Klinsmann supporter, but his time as head coach is over (only as head coach).
Who are they hiring next though? I don't want another Steve Sampson or Bruce Arena! Klinsmann challenges MLS and rightly so!
Buen trabajo chicos lamentablemente el árbitro se. Comió varias pero lo hicieron bien
Usa men's soccer did best copa America centralamerico four place
Good Job USA!!! Got lots of work to do but the progress is overwhelming!!!
They did a very good job! Inspite of loosing the game !
Para el mundial USA va encaminado...pero tienen q contratar a un tecnico pepa...x ejem...Sampaoli
Sad, but It doesn't matter if we didn't win the 3rd place, team USA you made a great match against Colombia. We enjoyed it! 👍🏻🇺🇸👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Well, im european! So... i think im neutral! Congrats to USA.... 4th place in Copa America its huge... Being ahead of national teams as Brazil, Mexico, Peru and all the others south americans teams its an excellent improvement! Even in this final match the man of the match was the colombian keeper, and that is a sign that US team gave a lot of work to Colombia keeper! USA gave a good replica in this Copa America and have to be proud of their players!
