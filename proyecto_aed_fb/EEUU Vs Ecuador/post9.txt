That is the first time U.S. Soccer has won 3 consecutive games at the Copa America. #Copa100
The USA played with a strategy to win the game. They cut Ecuador's running game and matched them physically.  Ecuador had a hard to react but never gave the game up. It took an USA second goal to really see Ecuador and it was too late.  Congrats USA!!!
USA played really well tonight. But I have to say that USA won't stand a chance against Argentina. Also they should stop parking the bus every time they go up with a goal. They did that tonight and days ago against Paraguay. We almost draw the game, unfortunately Enner couldn't push the ball like 3 times.
And the last time! 😂 There is an Argentinian Wall USA will not get through. Enjoy your last game
It was raining cards all over but great win USA. #oneteamonenation
They had the best diving and time consuming much wow USA......
Como subestimaban a USA jugaron bien, pero tienen un técnico muy malo. Haters gonna hate
Great play USA! Congratulations!
Good luck against Argentina
